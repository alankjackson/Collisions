## Bicyclist/Automobile Incidents in Harris County

Based on the [TxDOT](https://cris.dot.state.tx.us/public/Query/app/public/welcome) data from 2010 to 2017, I have analyzed incidents where cyclists got hit by cars. First we will begin with some general statistics, and then bore down to some more specific items.  

## CDC Data

From the website for the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/bicycle/index.html), we have the following information regarding Bicyclist incidents:  
Who is most at risk?  

Adults aged 50 to 59 years have the highest bicycle death rates.

Children (5-14 years) and adolescents (15-19 years) have the highest rates of nonfatal bicycle-related injuries, accounting for more than one-third of all bicycle-related injuries seen in U.S. emergency departments.

Males die 6 times more often and are injured 4 times more often on bicycles than females.

Most bicyclist deaths occur in urban areas and at non-intersection locations.

Among bicyclist deaths, 37% had alcohol involvement either for the motor vehicle driver or bicycle rider.


## Injury Distribution

The state has six categories of injury (if we include "Unknown"). Somewhat surprisingly, there are about 80 Bicyclist fatalies per year in the county. And about 2 incidents per day, on average.

It is important to keep in mind that there is almost certainly heavy reporting bias in these numbers. Every fatality and serious injury will likely get reported. Minor injuries may escape being reporting, and non-injury incidents are probably not reported most of the time.

```{r overall}

cyclists %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Severity)) +
  geom_bar(fill=SevereColor) +
  geom_label(aes(label=..count..), stat='count', size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       caption = caption)
```

## Injuries as a function of road type

It seems obvious that if you get hit on the freeway, you are more likely to die, but let's test that hypothesis, just to be sure.  
As the plot indicates, injuries on a highway are about as likely to be fatal, but most collisions occur on city streets. So, unlike pedestrians, fatality risk for bicycles does not seem to correlate to road type.

But what the heck is this "non trafficway" category of road? I think it must mostly be parking lots, with a few driveways thrown in.

```{r Injuries vs. RoadType}
cyclists %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=RoadType, fill=Severity), position="dodge" ) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual("Severity",values = c("gray", "green", "turquoise3", "purple", "orange", "red")) +
  xlab("Road Type")+
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Severity vs. Road Type", 
       caption = caption) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
       
```


## Data issues

Note that the data is not perfect, there are a few issues. Not all of the locations make sense, and so cannot be linked to a latitude and longitude location, limiting the analysis to a degree. Only `r round(100*nrow(cyclists %>% filter(!is.na(Latitude)))/nrow(cyclists),1)`% of the data is geocoded. 

## City Streets and Bicyclists

My primary interest is looking at city streets, to see where there may be hotspots, and to try to predict which spots are most likely to see a fatality or serious injury. So for now, I will restrict analysis to "City Streets".  

Let's consider what time of day these incidents occur. I have heard it proposed that many incidents may be due to bars letting out and people wandering into the road in an impaired state. Or perhaps the driver is impaired. 

Doesn't look like impairment is a major factor. It appears that the incidents peak during rush hour. Well, there is a minor peak at 2 AM when the bars close. And an intriguing jump at 3 PM. Is that related to school letting out? I'll have to look at that later.

```{r city street analysis}

citycyclists <- cyclists %>% filter(RoadType=="City Street")
citycyclists$Intersection <- as.factor(citycyclists$Intersection)

citycyclists %>% mutate(HourOfDay=hour(citycyclists$Crash_DateTime)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=HourOfDay), fill = "darkorchid4") +
  xlab("Hour of Day")+
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions, Houston City Streets, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Hour of Day", 
       caption = caption) 
       
```

## Day of Week

How about day of the week? Not surprisingly, Sunday is the low day. Other than Sunday, I would say that the other days of the week are basically equal in terms of number of incidents. 

```{r Day of Week}

citycyclists %>% mutate(Daynum=wday(Crash_Date)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wday(Daynum, label=TRUE))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid4") +
  xlab("Day of Week")+
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions, Houston City Streets, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Day of Week", 
       caption = caption) 
        
```


## Time of Year

Huge scatter, but really no obvious seasonal effect. Tells me that bicyclists are a dedicated bunch, and ride all year long without regard to weather.

```{r Time of Year, message=FALSE}

citycyclists %>% mutate(WkOfYear=as.Date(paste0("2000-",month(floor_date(Crash_Date, "week")),"-",day(floor_date(Crash_Date, "week")), "%Y-%m-%d"))) %>%
  group_by(WkOfYear) %>%
  summarise(WeeklyTotal=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=WkOfYear, y=WeeklyTotal)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()  +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b")+
  xlab("Month of Year") +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions, Houston City Streets, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Month of Year", 
       caption = caption) 
            
```

## Long-term trends - is it getting better?

I'd say that there is no obvious long-term trend. Not getting better, not getting worse. On the other hand, I suspect that the number of riders may be increasing, so a flat incident count wouold be good news. 

```{r Long Term Trends, message=FALSE}

citycyclists %>% mutate(ByWeek=floor_date(Crash_Date, "week")) %>%
  group_by(ByWeek) %>%
  summarise(WeeklyTotal=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ByWeek, y=WeeklyTotal)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()  +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Total Incidents per Week") +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions, Houston City Streets, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Weekly Totals", 
       caption = caption) 
            
```

## Where are the worst spots for number of incidents?

The worst is a location that has racked up 7 incidents in 7 years - about one incident per year. 108 locations have seen two incidents, 20 locations have seen three. If one were looking for a way to prioritize work, this might be a good place to start.


```{r Where are the worst spots for accidents}

citycyclistslatlng <- citycyclists %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Latitude)) 
 
badspots <- citycyclistslatlng %>%
  group_by(latlon) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  filter(total>1)

badspots %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=total)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid4") +
  geom_label(aes(label=..count..), stat='count', size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Number of locations with more than one incident", 
       caption = caption) +
    xlab("Number of Incidents")+
    ylab("Number of locations") 

```

## What controls the Severity?

What controls how serious an incident turns out to be? Most probably the speed of the vehicle. So let's take a look at that.  

Serious injuries clearly climb with speed. Not injured has a curious spike at high speeds, but the likely reporting bias for those numbers is so large I don't think any conclusions can be made. And fatality numbers are small enough that any conclusions from those would be suspect.

```{r Speed vs Severity}

#   round speed to nearest 5 mph

citycyclists %>% mutate(speed=as.integer((Crash_Speed_Limit+2.5)/5)*5) %>%
  filter(speed>0) %>%
  group_by(speed) %>%
  summarise(totbyspeed=n(),
            fatal=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==4),             
            serious=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==1),
            injury=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==2),
            maybe=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==3),
            okay=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==5),
            unk=sum(Crash_Sev_ID==0)) %>%
  mutate(fatalpct=fatal/totbyspeed,
         seriouspct=serious/totbyspeed,
         injurypct=injury/totbyspeed,
         maybepct=maybe/totbyspeed,
         okaypct=okay/totbyspeed,
         unkpct=unk/totbyspeed
         ) %>%
  select(speed, totbyspeed, fatalpct:unkpct) %>%
  rename(Fatal=fatalpct, Serious_Injury=seriouspct,  Non_Incapacitating=injurypct, Possible_Injury=maybepct, Not_Injured=okaypct, Unknown=unkpct) %>%
  gather(Severity, Pct, Fatal:Unknown) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=speed, y=Pct, color=Severity, weight=totbyspeed), se=FALSE, method='lm')+
  geom_point(aes(x=speed, y=Pct, color=Severity))+
  scale_color_manual("Severity",values = c("gray", "green", "turquoise3", "purple", "orange", "red"), labels=c("Unknown", "Not Injured", "Possible Injury", "Non-Incapacitating", "Suspected Serious Injury", "Fatal")) +
labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Severity Percentage versus Speed, weighted fit", 
       caption = caption) +
    xlab("Speed (mph)")+
    ylab("Severity Percentage") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")  
  

```



## What about Intersections?

Is there a pattern related to where the incident took place? At an intersection, or somewhere else? Are people hit crossing an intersection, or in the middle of the block?
It appears that about 2/3 of incidents are associated with intersections. My bet is that a big fraction are cars turning. Which may imply that bicycle lanes, while something I personally like, may have limited impact on safety.

```{r intersections}

citycyclists %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Intersection)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid4") +
  geom_label(aes(label=..count..), stat='count', size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Incidents Relative to Intersections", 
       caption = caption) +
    xlab("Location Type")+
    ylab("Number of Incidents") 

```

## How does the type of crossing relate to the injury severity?

The severity of incidents away from intersections is clearly worse than those at or near intersections. So maybe bike lanes are a good idea after all. While the number of incidents may be less, cars are likely traveling faster, and speed is bad.

```{r crossing vs severity}

citycyclists %>% filter(Intersection!="Not Reported") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Intersection, fill=Severity), position="dodge" ) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual("Severity",values = c("gray", "green", "turquoise3", "purple", "orange", "red")) +
  xlab("Location Type")+
  ylab("Incident Count")+
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Severity vs. Location Type", 
       caption = caption) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
       

```

## Another look at location type and injury severity

Here we see quite clearly - after consolidating "Intersection Related" and "Intersection" together - that not being at an intersection is much more dangerous. The likelihood of death is about 20% greater at non-intersections. Serious injuries are more likely to occur at intersections however - probably related to speed.

```{r Probability of injury vs location}

citycyclists %>%
  filter(Severity!="Unknown") %>%
  group_by(Severity, Intersection) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  mutate(Intersection=gsub(" ", "_", Intersection, fixed=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(Intersection=gsub("-", "_", Intersection, fixed=TRUE)) %>%
  spread(Intersection,total) %>%
  mutate(mysum=(Intersection + Intersection_Related + Non_Intersection)) %>%
  mutate(Intersection=Intersection + Intersection_Related,
  Intersection=Intersection/mysum, Non_Intersection=Non_Intersection/mysum) %>%
  select(Severity, Intersection, Non_Intersection) %>%
  gather(Location, Probability, -Severity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Location, y=Probability)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=Severity), position="dodge", stat='identity') +
   scale_fill_manual("Severity",values = c("green", "turquoise3", "purple", "orange", "red")) +
  xlab("Location Type")+
  ylab("Percent of Cases")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Bicyclist/Auto Collisions in Harris County, 2010-2017", 
       subtitle = "Severity vs. Location Type", 
       caption = caption) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```


## Where are most Incidents?

Lake Houston area looks pretty dangerous.

```{r Mean Streets, message=FALSE, results="asis"}

# Locations with 5 or more incidents
mytable <-  citycyclistslatlng %>%
  group_by(latlon, Rpt_Street_Name) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  filter(total>2) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Street=Rpt_Street_Name, Total=total)
print(xtable(mytable, auto=TRUE), type="html")
```


## Maps

Let's make some maps.  
If we plot all locations that had three or more incidents, we produce the map below. A Large concentration of incidents downtown - that's where many bicyclists are - but also some of the largest values are outside of downtown.

```{r Mapping more than 2}

zoom <- 10
center <- c(-95.4, 29.8)
gmap = get_map(location=center, source="google", zoom=zoom)

bad_bg <- 
  citycyclistslatlng %>%
  group_by(latlon, Latitude, Longitude) %>%
  summarise(total_bg=n()) %>%
  filter(total_bg>1)

ggmap(gmap, extent='normal', maprange=FALSE, show.legend=FALSE) %+% bad_bg + aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude) +
  geom_point(data=bad_bg, aes(size=total_bg,color=total_bg)) +
  scale_color_continuous(guide="colorbar", name="Total") +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.00, 0.35), guide = FALSE) +
  labs(title="Collisions 2010-2017", subtitle="Two or more incidents only", size="Total") +
  theme(legend.position = "right", axis.title = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

## Serious Incidents only

Let's look at locations that had a fatality or serious injury.  
Few obvious single locations pop out, however, a number streets resemble a string of pearls, indicating that there are stretches of some streets that seem to be particularly dangerous. 

```{r Mapping serious injuries}

zoom <- 11
center <- c(-95.4, 29.8)
gmap = get_map(location=center, source="google", zoom=zoom)

badspots <- 
  citycyclistslatlng %>%
  mutate(Injury = case_when(
    Severity %in%  Severity ~ "Serious",
    TRUE                   ~ "Non-Serious"
  )) %>%
  filter(Injury=="Serious") %>%
  filter(
    between(Latitude, HoustonBound[2], HoustonBound[4] ) &
    between(Longitude,HoustonBound[1], HoustonBound[3] )) %>%
  group_by(latlon, Latitude, Longitude) %>%
  summarise(Total=n()) 
  
ggmap(gmap, extent='normal', maprange=FALSE, show.legend=FALSE) %+% badspots + aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude) +
  geom_point(data=badspots, aes(size=Total,color=Total)) +
  scale_color_continuous(guide="colorbar", name="Total") +
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.00, 0.35), guide = FALSE) +
  labs(title="Collisions 2010-2017", subtitle="Fatal or Serious Only", size="Total") +
  theme(legend.position = "right", axis.title = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 12)) 
```






```{r set up for maps}

Serious <- c("Suspected Serious Injury", "Fatal")

badspots <- 
  citycyclistslatlng %>%
  mutate(Injury = case_when(
    Severity %in%  Serious ~ "Serious",
    TRUE                   ~ "Non-Serious"
  )) %>%
  mutate(TimeOfDay = case_when(
    between(hour(Crash_DateTime),7,20) ~ "Day",
    TRUE ~ "Night"
  )) %>%
  group_by(latlon, Latitude, Longitude, Injury, TimeOfDay) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) 

facetmap <- function(){
  badspots_bg <-bad_bg %>%
    filter(
      between(Latitude, Center[2]-0.01, Center[2]+0.01) &
      between(Longitude,Center[1]-0.01, Center[1]+0.01))
  
  badmap <- badspots %>% filter(
      between(Latitude,Center[2]-0.01, Center[2]+0.01) &
      between(Longitude,Center[1]-0.01, Center[1]+0.01)) 

  ggmap(gmap, extent='normal', maprange=FALSE, show.legend=FALSE) %+% badmap + aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude) +
    geom_point(data=badspots_bg, aes(size=total_bg, x = Longitude, y = Latitude), fill="yellow", shape=21, color="black", stroke=.5, show.legend=NA) +  
    geom_point(data=badmap, aes(size=total, x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color=total)) +
  facet_wrap(TimeOfDay ~ Injury) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +  # to remove the legend
    theme_bw() +             # for clean look overall
    scale_color_continuous(guide="colorbar", name="Subtotal") +
    scale_alpha(range = c(0.00, 0.35), guide = FALSE) +
    labs(title=paste("Bicyclist Collisions", Place,"2010-2017"), size="Total", subtitle="Yellow for total incidents of 3 or more, blue for subset by time and severity") +
    theme(legend.position = "right", axis.title = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 12)) 
}
```

##  Downtown

Not surprisingly, almost all incidents downtown occur during the day. St. Joseph Parkway, especially at San Jacinto, seems to be a bad spot. Smith around Tranquility Park, and a block away, Rusk at Louisiana is a bad spot. 

```{r faceted maps for downtown}

Center <- c(-95.367, 29.757)
Place <- "Downtown"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()
```

## Montrose/Midtown

Montrose is bad, day and night. It is also bad for pedestrians. Confusing intersections, heavy traffic, plenty of bars and restaurants - all add up to injuries and death.

```{r faceted maps for Midtown}

Center <- c(-95.39, 29.742)
Place <- "Midtown"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()


```

##  University Place

The poster child for bicycle fatalities due to the train collisions, but other serious incidents have also occured.

```{r faceted maps for University}

Center <- c(-95.405, 29.717)
Place <- "University Place"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()


```


## Chinatown


```{r faceted maps for Sharpstown}

Center <- c(-95.545, 29.710)
Place <- "Sharpstown"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()

```

## Atascosita

Will Clayton Parkway appears to be fairly dangerous for bicycles, with four incidents, one serious.

```{r faceted maps for Atascosita}

Center<- c(-95.208, 29.977)
Place <- "Atascosita"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()

```


## Airline

Airline and some other streets in the area form strings of pearls.

```{r faceted maps for Airline}

Center<- c(-95.384, 29.833)
Place <- "Airline"

gmap = get_map(location=Center, source="google", zoom=15)

facetmap()

```
